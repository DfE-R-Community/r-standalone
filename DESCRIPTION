Description: 
    This repo houses self-contained R scripts which implement 
    functionality commonly used in DfE code. To import a standalone script 
    into your own project, you can simply copy/paste the code into your own 
    repo, or alternatively (and preferably) do so with `usethis::use_standalone()`.
